(Verse 1)  
Hey, listen up, gather 'round, let me tell a tale,  
Of Podcasting 2.0, a ship that's set to sail.  
It ain't just audio, it's an interactive dream,  
A space where creators and listeners are on the same team.  

(Pre-Chorus)  
And when it comes to pay, oh what a lovely sight,  
With Bitcoin Lightning, it all feels so right.  

(Chorus)  
Podcasting 2.0, breaking the mold,  
Changing the game, it's pure gold.  
Value for value, it's the way we roll,  
Lightning fast Bitcoin, fills up the soul.  

(Verse 2)  
You can stream sats, while you're catching some wisdom,  
Micropayments make it easy, no need for a system.  
Boostograms, chapters, and more, oh what a view,  
Customized just for you, that's Podcasting 2.  

(Pre-Chorus)  
And when it comes to pay, oh what a lovely sight,  
With Bitcoin Lightning, it all feels so right.  

(Chorus)  
Podcasting 2.0, breaking the mold,  
Changing the game, it's pure gold.  
Value for value, it's the way we roll,  
Lightning fast Bitcoin, fills up the soul.  

(Bridge)  
You give what you can, you take what you need,  
It's a two-way street, let's all succeed.  
In a world where value truly reigns,  
Podcasting 2.0, breaking all the chains.  

(Chorus)  
Podcasting 2.0, breaking the mold,  
Changing the game, it's pure gold.  
Value for value, it's the way we roll,  
Lightning fast Bitcoin, fills up the soul.  

(Outro)  
So here we are, in this digital space,  
Making connections, at our own pace.  
With Podcasting 2.0, and Lightning in hand,  
We're building a future, oh ain't it so grand?
